* Tetris is a C# framework to enable your code to be translated into database CRUD operations plus procedures and functions interchangeably among the officially supported databases: SQLServer, Oracle and MySQL.

* The most important premise is: The meta code writen once can generate the target database object in **ALL** supported databases. It is an all or nothing approach.

* Using what I called 'Database Agnostic Intermidiate Objects', you can build the procedures used by your application on C# code.

### How to use Tetris in my project? ###

* Clone the repository and reference the Tetris.Common Visual Studio project in your application references.

* You can also download using NuGet executing the command: Install-Package Tetris
